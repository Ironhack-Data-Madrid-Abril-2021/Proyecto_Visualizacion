+ Clients know the come to the consultancy firm above all by social media engagement, particularly instagram. Moreover, referrals also seem to be working as a client engagement tool.
+ Most of the consultations happened in 2019, after two years of launch, pre-Covid19
+ Most popular quarter is Q3 (considering the 4 years), this is correlated to summer season happening in the countries of the clients.

+ Moreover, the consultant should deep dive in binge eating episodes and women with PCO's, as most of the clients face these struggles. 
+ Client engagement seems healthy, consultant should reinforce referrals as it does work. And focus on Q3 and Q4 as is when the consultant has peaks. Moreover, consultant should promote the business in Q2 (taking into account this quarter involved Ramadan last 3 years).
